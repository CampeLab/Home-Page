### Why should I take this course?
To develop advanced skills in designing experiments, defining and testing hypotheses, and performing statistical data analyses within your field of interest;

### If I take it, what will I learn?
By the end of this course, you should be able to:  

- Design experiments related to your work;  
- Perform the appropriate statistical analyses of the data obtained from the experiment;  
- Develop sound conclusions based on the available data;  
- Identify the main limitations of your experiments, and suggest improvements;  
- Perform critical interpretations of other experimental methodologies and results reported in the literature.

### How is this course organized?
The course activities are divided into four main types:  

- Lectures (approx. 8);  
- Computational case studies (4 or 5);  
- Final written exam;  
- Final project presentation.  

This is a course on **applied** experimental design and analysis. As such, a large portion of the course is dedicated to case studies in which you will design experiments, collect (simulated) data, perform inference and report on your analysis.

It is strongly reccomended that you come into this course having at least moderate fluency in [R](http://cran.r-project.org). There are a few very good introductory courses you can take for free, such as [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog) or the courses from [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses).


I also strongly reccomend that you complete the free online course [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata) before the fourth week of this course (except if you are already fluent with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)).

### Which materials do you use in this course?
The main reference are my [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/fcampelo/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments), which are available on GitHub. Douglas Montgomery's two books, _Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers_ (written with George Runger) and _Design and Analysis of Experiments_ are also used as references, and I draw heavily from Michael Crawley's excellent _The R Book_ and from Paul Matthew's _Sample Size Calculations: Practical Methods for Engineers and Scientists_. Selected papers from the stats literature, blog posts, and online materials are also used.

### Can I audit this course?
Usually yes, but it depends on how many regular students are enrolled. Please [drop me a message](mailto:fcampelo@ufmg.br) before the start of the term.
