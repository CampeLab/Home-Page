Stuff for the home page. This repo is intended for lab members only.

1. All figures should go into subfolders under the _Figures_ directory, according to the instructions in the [article template](https://github.com/ORCSLab/Home-Page/blob/master/article_template.md);
2. Write articles using the aforementioned [template](https://github.com/ORCSLab/Home-Page/blob/master/article_template.md);
3. If you use someone else's code, figures, or anything, **don't forget to properly attribute it!**. It is always better to ask for permission _before_ using anything.
