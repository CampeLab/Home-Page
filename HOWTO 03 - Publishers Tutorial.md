## Publisher's tutorial

_Vittor Faria_ 

###Introduction   

The joomla CMS has many types of access privileges, from the simple web site user to the _superuser_ that can change every single configuration of the page. This document shows the basic functions of the _publisher_ access level.

###The Publisher access group

Users belonging to the _Publishers_ group are allowed to post, edit, and publish any content item from the Front-end (not just their own). Publishers can review all articles, edit and change publishing options. Publishers can also determine when an article is ready for publication, making it visible to Registered and Author users, as well as to the general (unregistered) visitors, depending on the visibility properties chosen for the article.

###Instructions

Users with _publisher_ privileges can log into the [control panel](http://150.164.32.10/joomla/administrator) of the web page. Once logged in the publisher may use his or her permissions to review and publish (or unpublish) articles, as well as to create new ones.
  
Most of the publisher's stuff can be done in the "Article manager":

------- 

In the "Article manager" there is a list of all articles in the database.  

-------  

  
![articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ORCSLab/Home-Page/master/Figures/20150514-Vittor/articles.png)  
  
  
The articles marked with the red 'x' are not published, and the ones with the green 'v' are published. The publisher can change the status of the item simply by clicking in the simbol.
  
By clicking in an article's name, the publisher can also edit the contents of the article (as described in our [editing tutorial](http://git.io/vU0Zx)).

The main tasks of the publisher are:

- Reviewing (and eventually publishing) the items submitted by the _author_ users;

- Reporting to Prof. Felipe Campelo in case of any doubts regarding the contents or the publicability of any article;

- Proposing new content and updating the sections of the home page whenever needed.
  
  
That's all, folks!
