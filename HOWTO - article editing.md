Editing an article or a profile
----------------------------------

###Introduction

This document is meant to show the correct way for editing articles and profiles.
    

###Editing an article

To edit an aticle that you've created, you must be logged in the system. 
Once logged, you'll see an icon next to the articles you have permission to edit.

----

Note that in the image I'm logged as Super User, so I have permission to edit every article. If you're not an editor, the icon will appear only in the articles that you have created. 

By clicking the icon you'll be directed to the edition page, where you can modify the article.

You can also change the picture of the article, remembering that if the article is your profile, the "intro image" **must be in 200x245 resolution**. The "full article image" can have any resolution, observing, of course, how you want your article to look.

Don't forget of clicking save after editing.

Well, thats all folks.  
Thanks for reading!
