##Editing an article or a profile

_Vittor Faria_  

###Introduction

This document will guide you on how to edit articles and profiles in the ORCSLab home page.
    

###Editing an article

To edit an article that you've created, you must be logged in the system. 
Once logged, you'll see an icon next to the articles you have permission to edit.

----

Note that in the image above I'm logged as _Super User_, so I have permission to edit every article. If you're not an editor, the icon will appear only in the articles that you have created.

By clicking the icon you'll be directed to the edition page, where you can modify the article.

You can also change the picture of the article. **Important**: if you're editing your _profile_, the "intro image" **must be in 200x245 resolution**. The "full article image" can have any resolution, depending, of course, on how you want your article to look.

Don't forget to click _save_ after you're done.

That's all, folks!  
Thanks for reading!
